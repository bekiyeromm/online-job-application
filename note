### Full Command Sequence with Security Measures befor exporting and pushing dumped database file to github
# Anonymize sensitive data (example, should be done in SQL script)
mysql -u username -p -e "UPDATE users SET email = CONCAT('user', id, '@example.com'), password = 'hashedpassword';"

# Export the anonymized database
mysqldump -u username -p job_carrier > job_carrier.sql

# Encrypt the SQL dump
gpg -c job_carrier.sql

# Initialize a git repository
cd /path/to/your/sql/file
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/job_carrier_db.git

# Add the encrypted SQL file
git add job_carrier.sql.gpg
git commit -m "Add encrypted database dump"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master

By following these best practices and taking appropriate security measures, you can mitigate the risks associated with exporting and pushing databases to GitHub

#### To import and use the encrypted database, you'll need to decrypt it first. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to decrypt and import the database:

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/job_carrier_db.git
cd job_carrier_db

2. Decrypt the SQL Dump
Use gpg to decrypt the SQL dump file. You'll need the passphrase that was used to encrypt the file:

gpg -d job_carrier.sql.gpg > job_carrier.sql

This command will prompt you to enter the passphrase used during encryption. Once entered correctly, it will produce the decrypted job_carrier.sql file.

3. Import the SQL Dump into MySQL
You can now import the decrypted SQL dump file into your MySQL database:

mysql -u username -p job_carrier < job_carrier.sql

You'll need to replace username with your MySQL username. The job_carrier should be the name of the database where you want to import the data. If the database does not exist, you need to create it first:

mysql -u username -p -e "CREATE DATABASE job_carrier;"
mysql -u username -p job_carrier < job_carrier.sql
